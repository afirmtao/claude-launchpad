- have a ansible role "base-container"
- it will create a folder ~/stacks/base/
- it will write a Dockerfile from a template to ~/stacks/base/Dockerfile
- this dockerfile is based on arch linux
- the dockerfile is referenced in ~/stacks/base/compose.yml
- make sure the container runs as the non-root user
- mount the volume from ~ to ~ inside the container
- mount the docker socket
- mount all places which would be needed to run prometheus and node_exporter, so we can have access to the host system metric
- in the arch container, in the Dockerfile, install base-devel, nodejs, npm
- make global npm packages to install to ~/.npm, so it can be edited by the user
- make sure its in the $PATH
- install claude-code from npm
- start the compose.yml, make sure the container builds
- have a 'make login-base' target, to directly tap into the container
